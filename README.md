# Multimodal Neural Network Architecture for Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains the implementation of a Multimodal Neural Network designed to perform sentiment analysis. It integrates various types of data inputs to predict sentiment, leveraging the strengths of different modalities for enhanced accuracy and robustness.

## Features

- **Multimodal Integration**: Combines text and other data types for comprehensive analysis.
- **Docker Support**: Includes a Dockerfile for easy deployment and scaling.
- **Automated Workflows**: Utilizes Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker (for containerization)
- Jenkins (for CI/CD)

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hamzak11111/Multimodal-neural-network-architecture-for-sentiment-analysis.git
2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

To run the sentiment analysis model, follow these instructions:

1. Start the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py

2. For detailed analysis, refer to the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook code.ipynb
